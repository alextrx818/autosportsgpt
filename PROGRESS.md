### Code Implementation
- [x] Created initial sports monitoring agent (`auto_sports_agent.py`)
- [x] Implemented autonomous agent system (`autonomous_sports_agent.py`)
- [x] Set up live sports monitoring (`sports_gpt_live.py`)
- [x] Added environment variables configuration (`.env`)
- [x] Created reference implementation (`test_api_simple.py`) for match display format
- [x] Standardized match display format across all sports
- [x] Implemented proper period display for each sport type

## Pending Tasks

### Digital Ocean Deployment (High Priority)
- [ ] Set up Digital Ocean droplet
- [ ] Configure environment variables on cloud
- [ ] Deploy standardized code
- [ ] Set up continuous bot execution
- [ ] Monitor cloud performance

### AutoGPT Integration
- [ ] Complete AutoGPT installation and setup
- [ ] Configure AutoGPT with sports monitoring system
- [ ] Test AutoGPT functionality with live data

### Sports Monitoring Features
- [ ] Add match analysis functionality
- [ ] Create prediction system
- [ ] Set up alerts for important events
- [ ] Add support for more sports if needed
- [ ] Implement match statistics display
- [ ] Add league standings information

### Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests
- [ ] Set up integration tests
- [ ] Test system with live sports data
- [ ] Stress test cloud deployment

### Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive README
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Document setup process
- [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] Document match display format standards
- [ ] Add cloud deployment instructions

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Deploy to Digital Ocean to reduce local CPU usage
2. Complete AutoGPT installation on new computer
3. Test AutoGPT integration with sports monitoring
4. Add more sports monitoring features
5. Implement testing suite
6. Complete documentation

## Notes for Next Session
- Digital Ocean deployment is top priority
- All format changes should be tested in `test_api_simple.py` first
- VS Code devcontainer will handle most setup automatically
- May need to configure API keys in `.env` file on cloud server

## Environment Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Visual Studio Build Tools
- VS Code with Dev Containers extension
- Git
- Digital Ocean account (pending)

## Current Issues/Blockers
- Need to set up Digital Ocean environment
- Local CPU usage needs to be reduced through cloud deployment
