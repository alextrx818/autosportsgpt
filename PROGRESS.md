## 2025-01-30: Digital Ocean Logging Implementation

### 1. Log Access Implementation
Created `fetch_all_logs.py` to provide comprehensive access to all Digital Ocean App Platform logs:
- Runtime logs (via doctl)
- Crash logs (via doctl)
- Build logs (via Digital Ocean API)
- Deployment history

### 2. Current Deployment Status
Latest deployment (0a49ea4b) status:
- Phase: ERROR
- Cause: app spec updated
- Issue: Python package structure problem during build

### 3. Logging Methods Implemented

#### Runtime Logs
```powershell
.\doctl\doctl.exe apps logs APP_ID --type=RUN
```
Shows current application output and runtime behavior.

#### Crash Logs
```powershell
.\doctl\doctl.exe apps logs APP_ID --type=run_restarted
```
Shows logs from the last container crash.

#### Build Logs
Implemented API-based access:
```powershell
GET https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/apps/{app_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}/components/{component_name}/logs?type=BUILD
```
Shows detailed build process and any build failures.

### 4. Current Issues
1. Build failing due to Python package structure:
   - Error: "Unable to determine which files to ship inside the wheel"
   - Root cause: Missing proper Python package directory structure
   - Needs: Proper `src/` directory setup or `pyproject.toml` configuration

### 5. Next Steps
1. Fix build error by either:
   - Creating proper `src/autosportsgpt` directory structure
   - Or updating `pyproject.toml` to specify correct package paths
2. Monitor deployment logs to ensure successful build
3. Consider implementing log rotation or archival for historical analysis

### 6. Tools Created
Created `fetch_all_logs.py` with features:
- Unified interface for all log types
- Deployment history tracking
- Error reporting
- Build log access via DO API
- Automatic token handling

### 7. Environment Variables
Current configuration:
- DO_API_TOKEN: Set in app.yaml
- App ID: 5137f955-d71d-41a0-9774-fb35149ea21b
- Component: autosportsgpt
