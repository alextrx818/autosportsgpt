## Recent Changes Not Yet Verified
1. Environment variable handling in Dockerfile
2. Production environment setup
3. Multi-computer access configuration

## Next Session To-Do
1. Check if match fetching is working after deployment
2. Begin AutoGPT integration if current deployment is stable
3. Add proper logging to track bot performance
4. Consider adding a web interface for easier monitoring

## Notes for Next Developer Session
- Current deployment is being updated with environment variables
- Need to verify matches endpoint after deployment completes
- AutoGPT integration should only start after current deployment is stable
- All CPU-intensive operations should remain on Digital Ocean
