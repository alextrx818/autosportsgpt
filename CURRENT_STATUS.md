# Current Status (January 29, 2025 14:20 EST)

## Last Actions Taken
1. Deployed bot to Digital Ocean at `https://plankton-app-qyijl.ondigitalocean.app/`
2. Added `.env.production` with API keys
3. Updated Dockerfile to properly handle environment variables
4. Set up multi-computer editing capability with Windsurf

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Verify Digital Ocean Deployment**
   - Check if matches are being fetched after environment variable fix
   - Monitor logs for any errors
   - Test all API endpoints

2. **AutoGPT Integration**
   - Need to decide whether to run AutoGPT on Digital Ocean or locally
   - Plan integration between AutoGPT and sports bot
   - Set up proper communication channels

3. **Testing Needed**
   - Test bot from different computers
   - Verify deployment script works everywhere
   - Check API response times

## Known Issues
1. Match fetching may not be working (being fixed in current deployment)
2. Need to verify environment variables are properly set in Digital Ocean

## Access Information
- Digital Ocean URL: `https://plankton-app-qyijl.ondigitalocean.app/`
- Sports API Key: 180846-RVi16IBGld4Pvr
- Sports API Host: api.b365api.com

## Recent Changes Not Yet Verified
1. Environment variable handling in Dockerfile
2. Production environment setup
3. Multi-computer access configuration

## Next Session To-Do
1. Check if match fetching is working after deployment
2. Begin AutoGPT integration if current deployment is stable
3. Add proper logging to track bot performance
4. Consider adding a web interface for easier monitoring

## Notes for Next Developer Session
- Current deployment is being updated with environment variables
- Need to verify matches endpoint after deployment completes
- AutoGPT integration should only start after current deployment is stable
- All CPU-intensive operations should remain on Digital Ocean
